# Routing network traffic based on firewall logs using Machine Learning
The Internet is such an essential part of our lives nowadays, that it can be considered as one of the necessities to live a better life. However, with that said, it is also necessary that it is not being used for illegal activities and more so in private networks such as university campuses or corporate offices to protect and secure confidential data. That’s where the firewall comes into picture. A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. Hence it can be thought of as a safeguard that establishes a barrier between a trusted network (i.e. campus or office) and an untrusted network (i.e. internet).
The important part of firewall systems is obviously the security rules governing the network traffic. The proper routing of the traffic ensures that the network is secured with security policy and users don’t experience any unwanted hassle to access allowed web pages. Setting up a firewall system is a complex and an error-prone task as it is carried out by the administrators of the network and hence, they may be subject to human error and moreover with time they may be required to be modified to remain compliant with the security policy.
This case study is an attempt to design an effective system to control firewall traffic based on the logs.
